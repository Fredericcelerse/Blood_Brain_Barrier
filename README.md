# Predicting the ability of small molecules to cross the Blood Brain Barrier
This is a small tutorial on how we can use AI and Computational Chemistry to predict the ability of a small molecule to pass (or not) the Blood Brain Barrier

## Prerequists

### Anaconda

To execute the code, we will setup a specific environment using anaconda. To install it, go to this webpage: https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/

### Setup conda environment

We first create the conda environment: 
'''
conda create -n bbb python=3.8
'''

Then we activate the conda environment:
'''
conda activate bbb
'''

Once the environment is properly created, we will install the python libraries we need to execute the code:
'''
conda install 
'''
